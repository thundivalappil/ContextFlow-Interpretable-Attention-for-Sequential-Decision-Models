# ContextFlow-Interpretable-Attention-for-Sequential-Decision-Models
ContextFlow is a compact PyTorch project that learns attention-style influence weights over sequences, producing both predictions and an interpretable time-step importance map. Designed as a toy-sized but modern architecture, it is easy to extend to finance, fraud detection, logs, and time-series analytics.
